# Task 1 : Percentation prediction using linear regression<br>
This is a task 1 of the sparks internship in which i have performed <br>

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. The training data is given which is to be used to train the machine learning algorithm, then plot the actual vs predicted values, evaluate the model and visualise the data. The code is written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and the libraries used are: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and scikit-learn.

### Data set <br>
Data :  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv<br>
The data set contains 2 columns of no. of hours studied and scores<br>

## Steps followed <br>

1. Importing libraries<br>
2. Importing Data set<br>
3. Data Visualization<br>
4. Model training<br>
5. Model Testing<br>
